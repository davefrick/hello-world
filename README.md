# hello-world
Everyone needs to start somewhere, and for programmers that is usually with hello-world.

I'd like to share a little bit more of myself with the world, and allow everyone the opportunity to find humor as I stumble over learning new things and make hilarious mistakes. Oh I hope they are hilarious.
